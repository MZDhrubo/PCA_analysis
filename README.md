# PCA_analysis
This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using R. It demonstrates how to perform dimensionality reduction, visualize high-dimensional datasets, and interpret results for better insights.
# Features

1. Data preprocessing and standardization

2. PCA computation using prcomp() and FactoMineR

3. Scree plots, biplots, and variance explained visualization

4. Interpretation of principal components

5. Clean, reproducible R scripts and RMarkdown notebooks

# Requirements

- R (â‰¥ 4.0)

R- ecommended packages: ggplot2, factoextra, FactoMineR, dplyr

# Use Cases

- Reducing dimensionality in large datasets

- Visualizing complex multivariate relationships

- Identifying key variables driving variance

- Exploratory data analysis in machine learning pipelines
