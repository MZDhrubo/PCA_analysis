# PCA_analysis
This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using R. It demonstrates how to perform dimensionality reduction, visualize high-dimensional datasets, and interpret results for better insights.
Features

Data preprocessing and standardization

PCA computation using prcomp() and FactoMineR

Scree plots, biplots, and variance explained visualization

Interpretation of principal components

Example datasets for practice

Clean, reproducible R scripts and RMarkdown notebooks

Requirements

R (â‰¥ 4.0)

Recommended packages: ggplot2, factoextra, FactoMineR, dplyr

Use Cases

Reducing dimensionality in large datasets

Visualizing complex multivariate relationships

Identifying key variables driving variance

Exploratory data analysis in machine learning pipelines
